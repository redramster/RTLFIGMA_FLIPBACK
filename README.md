# RTLFIGMA_FLIPBACK
This will flip back flipped rtl text

This extension helps developers working with Figma and RTL languages. It is an enhancement to the RTL Support plugin for Figma.

The problem: To show correct RTL text in Figma you need to flip the texts in text fields. This is done by various plugins written for Figma. However, when developers, with no editing access wants to copy the texts it turns out flipped in their keyboard.

The solution:
1) Install the extension
2) Pin it to the extension bar at the top (optional)
3) Select the required text from a Figma field
4) Copy the text in the required field using ALT+C or clicking on the extension icon (instead of using CTRL+C|CMD+C)
5) Paste the text where ever you need it
